## **Web Development Roadmap: Your First Steps**

This course marks the beginning of your journey into web development. Here’s a simple roadmap to help you understand where you are and what your next steps should be.

---

### **1. Understanding the Structure of a Website**

Every website has two main parts:

- **Frontend**  
  The part users interact with in their browsers — includes visuals, layout, and user interactions.

- **Backend**  
  The behind-the-scenes part — responsible for storing and managing data, typically in databases, and providing this data to the frontend.

---

### **2. Web Development Career Paths**

Web development jobs typically fall into one of the following categories:

- **Frontend Developer**  
  Works on visual aspects using:
  - HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Defines the structure of web pages.
  - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Adds style and design to web pages.
  - JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.

- **Backend Developer**  
  Focuses on server-side logic, databases, APIs (not covered in this course).

- **Full-Stack Developer**  
  Works on both frontend and backend.

---

### **3. Core Frontend Technologies**

#### **HTML**
- Defines the structure and building blocks of a web page (e.g., images, text, buttons).

#### **CSS**
- Handles visual styling: fonts, colors, spacing, layout, responsiveness, animations.

#### **JavaScript**
- Adds interactivity and behavior (e.g., clicking a button, liking a tweet).
- It's a **programming language**, unlike HTML and CSS.

---

### **4. Web Page Analogy**

**Think of a web page like a building:**

- **HTML** = Structure (walls, rooms)
- **CSS** = Aesthetics (paint, tiles, decor)
- **JavaScript** = Functionality (elevators, doors that open)

---

### **5. Example: Building a Tweet Layout**

- **HTML**: Create layout blocks (image, username, message, icons).
- **CSS**: Style the page (bold text, rounded images, hover effects).
- **JavaScript**: Add functionality (liking, retweeting, commenting).

---

### **6. Learning Timeline for Beginners**

- **HTML & CSS**:  
  Spend 3–5 hours daily  
  → Gain solid foundation in 4–6 weeks

- **JavaScript**:  
  Continue for another 6 weeks  
  → Not an expert, but a practical understanding

- **Projects**:  
  Apply knowledge and continue learning by building things.

---

### **7. Frontend Frameworks and Libraries**

- Help streamline development and reduce repetitive tasks.
- Popular choices include:
  - **React** (library) — most widely used, recommended for beginners
  - **Angular** (framework)
  - **Vue** (framework)

> Once you know React, it’s easier to learn others as needed.

- Learning React may take 1–2 months.

---

### **8. Version Control with Git**

- Used to track code history and collaborate with others.
- **Git** is the most popular system (used by 70%+ of companies).
- Other systems: Subversion, Mercurial.
- Learning Git takes about **two weeks**.
- Essential for every job in web development.

---

### **9. Summary: Essential Frontend Skills**

Focus on these four core areas:

1. HTML  
2. CSS  
3. JavaScript  
4. Git

These are required in almost every frontend development job.

> **Tip:** Don’t try to learn too many things at once. Focus, practice, and grow steadily.

---

### **Next Topic**

We'll dive into **how the web works** — understanding the browser, servers, and what happens when you visit a website.


*** 3-_How_the_Web_Works ***

## **How the Web Works: Step-by-Step Explanation**

Have you ever wondered what happens when you type a website address into your browser and hit enter? In this lesson, 
we’ll walk through the entire process and explain key concepts every web developer should understand.

---

### **1. The Role of the URL**

- When you visit a website like `facebook.com`, the address you type in the browser is called a **URL**.
- **URL** stands for **Uniform Resource Locator**.
- It identifies and locates a specific resource on the internet.
  - Resources can be:  
    - HTML documents (web pages)  
    - Images  
    - Videos  
    - Fonts  
    - And more

---

### **2. The Client-Server Model**

- **Client**: Your browser
- **Server**: The computer that hosts the website
- Your browser (client) sends a request to the web server asking for the homepage.
- The server processes the request and sends back a response.

> This model is similar to sending a text message. Your phone sends (client), your friend’s phone receives (server).

---

### **3. Communication with HTTP**

- The browser communicates with the server using the **HTTP protocol**:
  - **HTTP**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol — a textual protocol for communication.
  - **HTTPS**: Secure version of HTTP with encryption.
- HTTP is not a programming language, but a set of rules for how clients and servers talk.

---

### **4. HTTP Request Example (Simplified)**

When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request like:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1  
Host: codewithmosh.com  
Accept-Language: en
```

- The browser requests `index.html` (often the homepage).
- It includes the host and other optional headers.

---

### **5. HTTP Response Example (Simplified)**

The server responds with an HTTP response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
Date: [server date & time]  
Content-Type: text/html  

<html>...</html>
```

- The `200 OK` status code means the request was successful.
- The server sends back the HTML document for the page.

---

### **6. The DOM (Document Object Model)**

- Once the browser receives the HTML, it constructs a **DOM**.
- The DOM is a structured representation of all the elements in the page.
- These include:
  - Paragraphs
  - Images
  - Links
  - Headings
  - And more

---

### **7. Fetching Additional Resources**

- While reading the HTML, the browser may find links to other resources:
  - Images
  - Fonts
  - CSS files
  - JavaScript files
- For each resource, the browser sends separate HTTP requests.
- These requests are often sent **in parallel** to improve performance.

---

### **8. Rendering the Page**

- Once all necessary resources are downloaded, the browser **renders** the page.
- **Rendering** means converting the HTML and resources into a visual display that you see in the browser.

---

### **Summary**

1. You enter a URL in the browser.
2. The browser (client) sends an HTTP request to the server.
3. The server sends back an HTTP response with the HTML document.
4. The browser parses the HTML and constructs the DOM.
5. The browser fetches other required resources.
6. Finally, the browser renders the page.

---

### **Next Lesson Preview**

In the next lesson, you’ll see these steps demonstrated in action.


*** 4-_Inspecting_HTTP_Requests_and_Responses ***

## **Inspecting HTTP Requests and Responses Using Chrome DevTools**


### **1. Accessing Chrome DevTools**

- Open **Chrome** and go to **google.com**.
- To open DevTools:
  - Go to the menu: `View > Developer > Developer Tools`
  - **Keyboard shortcuts:**
    - macOS: `Option + Command + I`
    - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or similar depending on version)
- Remember the shortcut for faster access in the future.

---

### **2. DevTools Layout**

- DevTools includes various tabs:
  - `Elements`, `Console`, `Sources`, `Network`, and more.
- We're focusing on the **Network** tab to inspect HTTP traffic.
- DevTools can be docked:
  - Bottom (default)
  - Left / Right
  - **Undocked** as a separate window (recommended for more workspace)

---

### **3. Refresh the Page to See Network Requests**

- After opening the Network tab:
  - Refresh the page to capture network traffic:
    - macOS: `Command + R`
    - Windows: `Ctrl + R`
    - Or click the **Refresh** button in the browser.
- You'll now see a list of **HTTP requests** made by the browser.

---

### **4. Analyzing HTTP Requests**

- Each item in the list is a request made to load a resource.
- The first request is usually for the **HTML document** (e.g., `google.com`).
  - **Request Type**: `document`
  - **Status Code**: `200 OK`
  - **Transferred Data**: e.g., 94KB
  - **Time Taken**: Duration to get the response

---

### **5. Viewing Request Details**

- Click on any request to view more info.
- In the **Headers** tab:
  - **General Info**:
    - **Request URL**
    - **Request Method**: usually `GET`
    - **Status Code**: e.g., `200`
    - **Remote Address**: IP of the server
  - **Response Headers**:
    - **Content-Type**: e.g., `text/html`
    - **Date**: Response timestamp
- In the **Preview** tab:
  - See a rendered preview of the HTML document returned from the server.

---

### **6. Loading Additional Resources**

- The initial HTML document includes links to:
  - Images (e.g., `.png`)
  - Fonts (e.g., `.woff`, `.ttf`)
  - CSS, JavaScript files
- Each of these resources triggers **separate HTTP requests**.
- You can identify these in the list below the main request.

---

### **7. Filtering Requests**

- Use the **Filter icon** to narrow down request types:
  - `All` (default)
  - `Doc` – HTML documents
  - `Font` – Font files
  - `Image`, `Script`, `XHR`, etc.

---

### **Next Steps**

- In the next lesson, you'll learn how to:
  - Create your **first HTML document**
  - Write basic content
  - Explore how different fonts and resources are used
  - Learn how to **publish files online**, potentially via platforms like YouTube

*** 5-_HTML_Basics ***

# **Creating Your First HTML Document**

### 1. **Setup**

- **Create a folder** on your desktop or anywhere on your computer. Name it `html` (or any other name).
- **Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.
- Go to the **Explorer panel**, select **“Open Folder”**, and open the newly created folder.
- Inside this folder, create a new file named `index.html`.
  - `index.html` typically represents the homepage of a website.

---

### 2. **Basic HTML Structure**

#### a. **DocType Declaration**
- Begin with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
  - This tells the browser you’re using HTML5.
  - Although HTML is not case-sensitive, the convention is to use uppercase for `DOCTYPE`.

#### b. **HTML Boilerplate**
- Add the `<html>` element using `html` + `Tab`.
- Inside `<html>`, add:
  - `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document.
  - `<body>`: Contains visible content.

#### c. **Head Section**
- Add a `<title>` element inside `<head>`.
  - Example: `<title>My First Web Page</title>`

---

### 3. **Launching with Live Server**

- Save the file (`Cmd + S` on Mac, `Ctrl + S` on Windows).
- **Right-click** in the editor and choose **“Open with Live Server”**.
- The browser opens at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/index.html`.
  - `127.0.0.1` is the loopback IP (your local computer).
  - The port number is where your local server listens for requests.

---

### 4. **Adding Content to the Body**

#### a. **Image Element**
- Use the `<img>` tag to display an image:
-------------------code----------------------
  <img src="images/mosh.jpg" />
-------------------code----------------------
- **Differences of `<img>`:**
  - It is a **self-closing tag** (does not need a closing tag).
  - In HTML5, you **do not need** a trailing slash (`/`) at the end.
- Create an `images` folder in the project directory.
- Drop the desired image inside it (e.g., `mosh.jpg`).
- The `src` path becomes `images/mosh.jpg`.

#### b. **Text Content**
- Add a paragraph for the Twitter handle:
-------------------code----------------------
  <p>@moshhamadani</p>
-------------------code----------------------
- Add another paragraph for the tweet content:
-------------------code----------------------
  <p>I love to teach you HTML.</p>
-------------------code----------------------

---

### 5. **Viewing the Page**

- When using Live Server:
  - The page **auto-refreshes** upon saving changes.
- The image and text elements now appear on the page.
  - However, the layout and styling are plain.
  - It doesn’t look like a tweet yet because **CSS has not been applied**.

---

### 6. **Conclusion**

- **HTML** defines the **structure** of a web page.
- In the next lesson, **CSS** will be introduced to style and visually enhance the content.
